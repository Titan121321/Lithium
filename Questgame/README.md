Hello, this is our project "Vanquest". Its our interpretation of life, considering our daily tasks as monsters and completing or vanquishing those tasks giving us points which are then converted to ETH which is deposited in your wallet. 

There are three types of tasks/monsters ; 
1.Light Duty/Goblin - 2 points
2.Medium Duty/Giant - 3 points
3.Heavy Duty/Dragon - 5 points

The user can choose up to 6 tasks a day all varying between these three types and add description to it. The character moves along the a defined path and move past the task/monster if they do their task and interact accordingly (there will be 2 options, Task DONE or NOT DONE). If the user doesn't do a task, they lose respective points. If they do a task, they gain respective points. At the end of the day (24 hours after starting the game), the game will evaluate the number of points you collected and sends the respective amount of ETH to the users wallet.

There is one pre made user, its username and password will be given below. 

All art in the game is hand-drawn.
